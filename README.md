# CryptoClustering
Showcase the use of unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## Repo Description/Outline:

Using crypto price data in a csv, data is scaled/transformed for use in unsupervised machine learning. Some other forms of data manipulation include:

- Finding the best value for k using the KMeans algorithm
- Making predictions and placing them on a scatter plot using hvplot
- Using the PCA algorithm to compare filtered data

Visualzations of these relationships can be found in the output folder.

## Repository Contents:

- Resources folder containing: 
  - crypto_market_data.csv

- Output folder containing:
  - plots created in the jupyter notebook

- Jupyter Notebook used to perform the machine learning


## Notes & Resources:

Dataset used was provided by Rutgers University in class files
